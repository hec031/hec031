- which I'm still updating and supporting.
- More recently I've developed an App for Tampa General Hospital - Children's Medical Center (https://www.tgh.org/childrens-medical-center-dedicated-team) that gives kids
- waiting to get their rooms a tablet that manages their access to safe games, music, movies and books that they can entertain themselves with while they wait.
