- 👋 Hi, I’m @hec031
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of development, from AR/VR/XR, App and Game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and anything. I'm always willing to learn something new.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone that wants to work with me or thinks I can help them.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is via my Accretion Studios Email, which is accretionstudios001@gmail.com

- I've been a Unity developer for over 4 years. I have participated in the Global World Jam (https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/last-programmer) 
- on a project called "The Last Programmer" and the Orlando Mega Health Jam (http://healthgamejam.com/) on a project named "Fluid".
- I've released one game on Android, and IOS called "A10 Arcade Shooter" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AccretionStudios.A10_Arcade&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- which I'm still updating and supporting.
- More recently I've developed an App for Tampa General Hospital - Children's Medical Center (https://www.tgh.org/childrens-medical-center-dedicated-team) that gives kids
- waiting to get their rooms a tablet that manages their access to safe games, music, movies and books that they can entertain themselves with while they wait.
